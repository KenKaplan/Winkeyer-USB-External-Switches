# Winkeyer-USB-External-Switches

A set of 6 switches that will activate the 6 memories in a Winkeyer USB.

May be suitable with other Winkeyers, but I only have the original Winkeyer USB.

Surface mount, using 1210 resistors.

You will need to mount a stereo jack on your Winkeyer.

Connected by a 3.5mm stereo cable.

The Gerber files will produce 2 boards, so you will have to cut them apart.
